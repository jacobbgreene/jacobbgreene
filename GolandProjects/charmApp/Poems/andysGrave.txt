Its August.
its the big face of Buddha
stuck in the cemetery's Douglas Firs.
Its cold and calm,
nirvana on Grandma's face,
It's                                              running water
over the portrait on Andy's grave.
It's feeding the Loropetalum
                                                   next to him.

It's roots in shade,
it's dirt,
it's                                               purple leaves.

It's hay bales on a clean field,
It's the sun and it's warmth
It's                                               seeing
your feet melt into soil and
your limbs stretching upwards
to                                                whoever.
It's the way Grandma tells us stories
of how she used to be a mother.
It's the way we say nothing.

It's drinks at dinner,
it's an                                          old fashioned,
Between cups of coffee,
its a bird outside calling in tempo
Every morning.
It's knowing your grandparents write down their prayers,
It's seeing them talk softly to
Each other in the car,             its unmoving
its praying for Andy,
it's missing parents,

it's                                             when
I make grandma laugh at dinner
And I hear her old friend say he saved
men who lost themselves
in the wilderness,
It's the hole I dig with a spoon
Into the center of a chocolate cake.
It's wondering if a seed crushed inside
could make something grow.
It's when
I see the rest of us smiling,
Even Andy.
